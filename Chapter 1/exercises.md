## Question 1:

### What is Design Pattern?

- Design patterns provide a template solution to core of some recurring problems in a way they are re-usable.

## Question 2:

### List down four essential elements of patterns.

- Name of the pattern
- Problem
- Solution
- Consequences

## Question 3:

### What is MVC Architecture?

- MVC is Model-View-Controller architecture

## Question 4:

### What are all the criteria used to classify design pattern?

- Scope of the design pattern
- Purpose of the design pattern

## Question 5:

### Name three classifications of design patterns based on purpose of the design pattern.

- Creational Patterns
- Behavioural Patterns
- Structural Patterns

## Question 6

### Name two classifications of design patterns based on scope of the design pattern.

- Object scoped
- Class scoped

## Question 7

### Write notes on Object, Methods, Requests.

Object: Object handles requests via its methods.

Methods: Methods handle requests. A method has a name, input parameters and output type which together known as the
signature of a method.

Requests:

## Question 8

### What is encapsulation?

- Encapsulation is hiding implementation

## Question 9

### What is Facade and Flyweight patterns?

## Question 10

### Write notes on operation's signature in an object

- Operation has a name, input parameters and an output type. All of these together known as the signature of the
  operation.

## Question 11

### Write notes on interfaces in Object oriented systems.

- Interface defines the type of object.

## Question 12

### What is dynamic binding of an object?

- Dynamic binding means that the object's binding to its implementation will happen at run-time and not at compile time.

## Question 13

### Write notes on abstract class.

- Abstract class contains mostly abstract methods where there implementation is done by the class which implements the
  abstract class. Abstract classes can contain methods with their implementation too. These types of classes cannot be
  instantiated.

## Question 14

### Define concrete classes

- Classes that are not abstract are known as concrete classes

## Question 15

### Define Mixin class

- Mixin class provides additional functionalities to a class. Mixin class requires multiple inheritance

## Question 16

### Name two techniques for reusing functionality in Object oriented systems.

- Reusing with subclassing
- Reusing with object composition

## Question 17

### Define white-box reuse

- Reusing with subclassing is known as white-box reuse since the derived class has the visibility to its parent class's
  methods.

## Question 18

### Define black-box reuse

- Reusing with object composition is known as black-box reuse. The resulting object does not have the visibility to
  implementation details of the objects that the class is composed of.

## Question 19

### What are all the disadvantages of class inheritance.

- Subclass has the visibility to its parent class methods. Therefore, this breaks the encapsulation.
- Class inheritance belongs to compile-time and it is static.

## Question 20

### What is delegation?

- In delegation , an object delegates its request to another objet which has appropriate methods to handle such
  requests. Delegation includes redirects.

## Question 21

### What is the main advantage of delegation?

- Reuse

## Question 22

### What are all the disadvantages of delegation?

## Question 23

### Write notes on Acquaintance relationship of objects.

- Acquaintance means an object has another object where both can survive without the other.
